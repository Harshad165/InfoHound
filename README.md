## Problem 

AI chatbots are powerful tools, but they can sometimes generate incorrect or misleading information. This undermines user trust and can have negative consequences for businesses.

## Technical Overview

InfoHound employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide factually accurate and contextually grounded chatbot interactions.  It integrates these key AI components:

![RAG](https://github.com/Harshad165/InfoHound/assets/56105291/0d3de0b3-cffd-47d1-b0a5-81dc54110d80)

* OpenAI Embeddings: Enable semantic similarity search, ensuring the most relevant website information is retrieved based on the user's query.
* Chroma: Provides an efficient and scalable vector store for website content.
* GPT-4: Generates fluent and informative responses, conditioned on the retrieved website knowledge.

## Architecture

* Document Loading & Preprocessing:  InfoHound uses WebBaseLoader to extract content from the specified website.  The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter breaks this content into chunks for efficient storage and retrieval.

* Vector Store Creation: Chroma creates a scalable database of semantic embeddings generated by OpenAI Embeddings.  This enables InfoHound to find the most relevant website sections based on the meaning of the user's query.

* Retrieval Chain:  A custom retrieval chain, powered by ChatOpenAI, first analyzes the conversation history to understand the context.  It then generates a refined search query to locate the most pertinent information from the vector store.

* Response Generation Chain: Retrieved website passages are integrated into the prompt for the ChatOpenAI language model. This ensures that the chatbot's response aligns with the factual information found on the website.
